# BCI EEG Signal Analysis (Practice)

## Overview
This repository contains a basic practice project for analyzing EEG-like
time series data using signal processing and machine learning techniques.

## Goal
- Understand EEG signal characteristics
- Apply preprocessing and feature extraction
- Perform simple classification

## Methods
- Band-pass filtering
- FFT-based feature extraction
- Machine learning (SVM)

## Dataset
- Public or simulated EEG time-series data

## Results
Example frequency spectrum of EEG signal:

## Environment
- Python 3.x
- NumPy, SciPy, scikit-learn, Matplotlib

## Notes
This project is for educational and research practice purposes.
